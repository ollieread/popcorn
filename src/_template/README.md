A macro-framework for PHP â€” a "just-enough" framework that gives you structure, clarity, and flexibility without the
bloat.

## But why?

No real reason besides I wanted to.
Projects don't always need a purpose beyond "I wanted to build it", or "what if...".
Popcorn is one of my what-ifs, and I'm building it simply for the sake of building it.

## What is it?

So it's a PHP framework designed to be lightweight, but not quite as lightweight as something like Slim, which
is, if I'm being honest, a glorified router.

## Why Popcorn?

I actually tend to name projects using words my youngest daughter says, that jump out at me.
This particular one, 'popcorn', jumped at am when she asked for some when we were going to watch The Wild Robot.

## How to use it

You'll have to wait and see.
